Is the Github documentation - commits and README - thorough and descriptive?
	Yes, there are many commits and they are descriptive 
Is there good spec coverage?
	Pretty good coverage for model/unit tests except should test for def average rating
Do all specs pass?	
	Should test integration more and fix the one that is currently there
Is the application logic clear and easy to navigate?
	There needs to be a movie in the db otherwise it will not load because of nilclass on movies_path
Can you make a test payment through Stripe?
	You cannot. 
Is the site user-friendly?
	Need to set a root route!
	Sorting should just change the list without addind another search results heading
Are there opportunities for refactoring?
	use before_action in controllers to set defaults for variables so you don't have to repeat them in each action
What features stand out?
	featured film and random image is cool
What features could be improved?
	it could use more features, style forms
Do you have any additional constructive criticism or positive feedback to share?
    	good use of RESTful controllers, slim models, clean searching. could benefit from better spec coverage, more styling/interactivity, and make the title helper on all pages.
	should have an index on movie title so that it is faster in sorting in the db.
        Don't have a ton of <br> tags. 
	Indent private methods more to make it easier to read
